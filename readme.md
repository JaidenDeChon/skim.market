skim.market is a small, simple webpage for quickly scanning over the top Forex pairs. Currently, it features 13 pairs: 

EURUSD

USDJPY

GBPUSD

USDCHF

USDCAD

AUDUSD

NZDUSD

EURGBP

EURAUD

GBPJPY

CHFJPY

NZDJPY

GBPCAD

New features may be added in the future. It's not currently optimized for mobile-- I don't recommend trying it on 
anything but desktop until that's fixed. 

I know "market" is vague but that was on purpose. Over the course of the development of this project, I plan to add 
the ability to view more than just Forex pairs, such as stocks and cryptocurrency. 

Feautures / additions that I'd like added in the future: 
 - Mobile compatibility, first and foremost
 - Light / Dark mode toggle
 - Ability to "favorite" charts for instant viewing 
 - Toggle for Forex/Stocks/Crypto
 - Adsense
 - Customize what the charts show, e.g indicators
